TODO
----

- Move files to Richard's github

Maybe
.....

- Compare parallaxes to Lauren's cleaned parallaxes, and also the geometric distances paper (and their posteriors?)!
- Switch to variational network (or MC dropout?) and produce estimated uncertainties around the "true" parallax. Use this with https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10121 to calculate new geometric distances.
- Add data from other surveys too
- Use variational neural network so can predict error on true parallax?

Questions/things for meeting
............................

- To use distance prior or not?
    - Maybe? Should ask David Hogg.
- To combine other datasets - for parallax?
    - Combining PanSTARRS - works better!!
- How to quantitatively evaluate cleaning? Do you look at another distance catalog?
    - Richard will think about this.
    - Lauren: maybe can just look at how far are from theoretical curve in magnitude-color space!

DONE
----

- (DONE) Make side-by-side plots of before and after cleaning
- (DONE) Add a distance prior
    - Didn't really work well!
